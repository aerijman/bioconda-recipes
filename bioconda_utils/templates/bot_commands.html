<h1>Commands understood by [{{request.app['name']}}]</h1>

<p>The list below is generated from code and should therefore always be
complete and authoritative.</p>
<p>Commands can be issued to from PRs and Issues at

  or from the Gitter channel <a href="https://gitter.im/bioconda/bot">bioconda/bot</a>.</p>
<p>Please note that most commands require Bioconda membership and that some commands require
  membership in particular teams.</p>
